# React Native Coding Challenge

In this challenge you're going to create a basic ecommerce app with React Native and typescript.

For this you use a public API to simulate an ecommerce.

Therefore, you must use the API https://fakeapi.platzi.com and use it to create an application that allows you to view the products and their categories.

## Requirements:

* Show a list of products with a searchbar (It must be possible to filter).
* Each product must show the following data: first image, title, price and category.
* Once the user taps on a product, they navigate to a detail screen for that product.
* The detail screen must have a carrousel of product images.
* The app must be protected with a login.

## What will we evaluate?

- Code quality
- Code complexity
- Usage of hooks
- Networking code
- Language skills
- Project structure
- Global state use

## Extra points:
*(Not mandatory, You can choose the ones you want additionally)*
- Unit tests
- Format price in a scalable way (set to dollar)
- Add "Related Products" section to product detail screen (other products in the same category)
- Data caching
- Renew the authorization token automatically
- Have an account registration flow
- Surprise us with some other feature 

## Notes:

* You should use [React Native bare](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Keep in mind that the app must be easily executable.
* Send us your code in a github repo.

Good luck!
